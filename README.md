# PNP-Numerical-Solver

## Installing the Necessary Dependencies for the Python Interface
To remain consistent with package/dependency management best practices, either a Conda environment or a Docker container should be used to manage dependencies for FEniCS/Dolfinx.

To create/activate the conda environment, run:

`conda create -n <environment-name>`

`conda activate <environment-name>`

`conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx mpich pyvista matplotlib cycler`

You can then easily deactivate/reactivate it with:

`conda deactivate`

`conda activate <environment-name>`

## Using Firedrake
Because dolfinx does not support dolfin-adjoint, I am exploring the use of Firedrake as an alternative.

This is because there exists an alternative algorithmic differentiation tool, Pyadjoint, that is built on Firedrake.

To create/activate the conda environment, run the same commands as above in order to activate or deactivate it.

Here is a link to detailed installation instructions: `https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html`

### In Docker
This is the easiest method (in my opinion) of running Firedrake.

To pull, the image, run `docker pull firedrakeproject/firedrake:latest`

Once pulled, run the image using `docker run -it --rm \
    -v /home/banman03/Euclid/AdaLovelace/pp/PNP-Numerical-Solver:/home/firedrake/shared \
    firedrakeproject/firedrake:latest
`. (This runs the container with root privileges as well as mounts your local files within the docker container so that your files can call the tooling within the container. It runs as root so be careful with any commands you run while the container has elevated privileges)


## Relevant Repositories
- `dolfin-adjoint repo`: https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/dolfin-adjoint
- `dolfinx repo`: https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx (this contains both the Python and C++ interfaces; I am going to try solving with the C++ interface as it is more verbose)
